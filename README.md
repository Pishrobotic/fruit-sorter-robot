Sorts apples based on there amount of damage and contamination using OpenCV image processing and Lego EV3 brick

### Project discription
This project was made with Lego mindstorms EV3 brick and uses python as its programming language. This robot uses a mix of lego and non-lego parts for more durability.

### Technologies
- Mechanical:
  - Use of 3D sketching software SolidWorks for designing the robot.
  - Use of laser cutting and CNC for making parts.
- Software:
  - Image processing with Python and OpenCV library.
  - Detect contamination and size using image processing.

### Open-source
You can use diffrent parts of this project and contribute to it. All files from Python code to mechanical CAD files are availble in the project directory.
